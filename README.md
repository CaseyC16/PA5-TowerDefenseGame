# Rules

You are a squirrel, and the humans are trying to burn down your forest, so as retaliation, you
will fight back using your army of squirrels fueled by acorns dropped from the slain humans.
As the game progresses, more and more humans will continue arriving in the forest, leading to
more acorns, more squirrels, and more chaos.

In short, purchase specialized squirrels from fallen humans to defend the forest.
